        <p>My name is Malcolm and I'm a student of Computer Science and Anthropology at UIUC (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign). "What a strange combination of fields," you're probably thinking. I agree, but at the same time, it's an awesome discipline that I can't praise enough. Through it, students gain the same core knowledge of computer science as pure CS majors as well as a strong background in the humanities to provide a unique perspective on technological challenges. I think the most important part of creating technology is making sure it as user-friendly and helpful as possible for anyone who uses it. My interests include software engineering, data science and basically all things related to data, and computer-human interaction. I'm also very interested in biological anthropology, namely primatology and paleoanthropology. </p>
        <p>I actively work with C++, Python, Java, and VBA/Excel, and in the past I've worked with C#, R, GML, and of course this website is programmed in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Although not related to computer science, I also work a lot with multimedia editing tools such as Photoshop and Sony Vegas, which I use to create projects for honors courses as well as YouTube videos.</p>

            <h3>Software Engineering Intern at AvTech Corp.</h3></a>
        </div>
        <p>For the past two summers now, I've been an intern for the software engineering department at AvTech Corp., creating and improving programs relating to the aviation industry. My most interesting projects have been a Python application that efficiently and securely communicates with proximity beacons via LoRaWAN technology, and a VBA (Excel) schedule generator to help airport staff assign drivers to service flights throughout the workday given a set of constraints. For both projects, I actively communicated with clients and wrote up detailed project reports to guide users through setup and execution of the programs. Additionally, I have spent some time parsing through huge codebases to implement new features and find bugs within existing applications, primarily in Java. I also did a little bit of testing of both hardware and software. </p>

            <h3>Discrete Structures (CS 173) Course Assistant at UIUC</h3></a>
        </div>
        <p>In Spring of 2023, I was a course assistant for the introductory discrete mathematics class for computer science majors. During this time, I held scheduleded office hours, attended discussion sections, an answered student questions on Discord and course forums to help teach students aboutn fundamental computer science topics. Such topics include algorithm analysis, boolean algebra, recursion, sets, graphs, and trees.</p>

            <h3>Elden Ring Speedrun Optimizer</h3></a>
        </div>
        <p>In Spring 2023, I and a few friends created a C++ program that reads in data from the Elden Ring map and calculates an optimal speedrunning route using various modifications of graph traversal algorithms like Dijkstra's and Floyd-Warshall to find shortests paths while simultaneously accounting for all the intricacies of the video game and enforcing certain pathways (you can't fight Radahn without visiting Altus first!). In the end, the calculated times for our routes were within 5% of actual speedrun world records! Finally, using the path we calculated, we used Python and Matplotlib to visualize the route via a path drawn over the actual Elden Ring map. I've tried the route myself in-game and it works pretty well! </p>

        <p>In Summer 2022, I developed a Discord chat bot that can hold a conversation by parsing and reacting to words a user sends, and access and send files. This was all possible with Discord's API tools and the Python programming language.</p>

        <p>If I'm not doing all of these above activites, I'm probably playing some instrument (drums, guitar, or piano) or some challenging video game (Elden Ring, Dark Souls, Sekiro, Hollow Knight, Hades, Dead Cells). I can also roll a quarter across my knuckles like Val Kilmer and if you send me a picture of some random primate, I can probably tell you what species it is.</p>
