        <h1>Hello there!</h1>
        <p>(If you can say a fitting follow-up line (whether it be from Star Wars or the blink-182 song), we could definitely be friends.)</p>
        <p>My name is Malcolm and I'm a student of Computer Science and Anthropology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). My interests primarily lie in computer systems, networks, and architectures. I'm also very interested in paleoanthropology, or the study of human evolution from the early apes to modern humans (no, there isn't much overlap, I know).</p>
        <p>I actively work with C, C++, C#, Python, Go, Javascript/Typescript, HTML, and CSS, and in the past I've worked with Java, x86 and MIPS Assembly, VBA, Verilog, SQL, R, and GML. Outside of computer science, I also work a lot with multimedia editing tools such as Photoshop and Sony Vegas, which I use to create video essay projects for school and YouTube (fun fact: these YouTube videos have a total of over 1,000,000 views!).</p>

            For the past three summers now, I've been an intern for the software engineering department at AvTech Corp., creating and improving programs relating to the aviation industry. I do all sorts of full-stack development, from backend C# programs to web consoles and Android user-interfaces. <br><br>
            
            My most interesting projects have been an interactive map web console in Typescript that displays real-time locations of buses, a backend service in C# to parse bus location information from a database and calculate estimated arrival times, a Python application that efficiently and securely communicates with proximity beacons via LoRaWAN technology, and a VBA (Excel) schedule generator to help airport staff to assign van drivers to service flights throughout the workday given a set of constraints. I often also actively communicate with clients and write up detailed project reports to guide users through setup and execution of the programs.</p>

            From January to May 2024, I was a course assistant for UIUC's computer architecture class. My primary job was to hold office hours to guide students through the creation and debugging of lab assignments focused on CPU design and optimization. We build some really cool stuff in these labs: we start off by creating simple computer components like register files and ALUs and move on to create fully-functional 32-bit CPUs, all in Verilog. Then we optimize these CPUs by adding in pipelining and interrupt handling. We then transition into MIPS Assembly coding assignments, which focus on teaching students how machine-level programming works, culminating in a project called Lab Spimbot that requires students to optimize the movement of a virtual robot using interrupt handling in Assembly. Additionally, some assignments have students create and optimize simulations of caches as well as implement parallelism, all in C and C++. I also taught students the conceptual bases behind these topics and more.

            In Spring of 2023, I was a course assistant for the introductory discrete mathematics class for computer science majors at UIUC. I held scheduled office hours, attended discussion sections, and answered student questions on Discord and course forums to help teach students about fundamental computer science topics. Such topics included algorithm analysis, boolean algebra, recursion, sets, graphs, and trees.</p>

            In Spring of 2024, I led a team of 4 engineers over 8 weeks to construct a simplified Linux-like operating system (or kernel) from scratch in C and x86 Assembly. The final product (with over 13,000 lines of code) was a system that functions almost like a real kernel would. To implement it, we started with the basics: getting the system to boot by initializing the appropriate kernel-level data structures and initializing the hardware devices that handle interrupts. We then developed comprehensive device drivers for the keyboard, terminal, real-time clock, and timer. We implemented features to ensure security and speed, including virtual memory and file system abstractions. And the pièce de résistance of the project was support for running multiple processes simultaneously, including scheduling, system calls, and interrupt handling. </p>

            In Spring of 2023, I and a few friends created a C++ program that reads in data from the Elden Ring map and calculates an optimal speedrunning route using various modifications of graph traversal algorithms like Dijkstra's and Floyd-Warshall. The algorithms find shortest paths between nodes while simultaneously accounting for all the intricacies of the video game and enforcing certain pathways (you can't fight Radahn without visiting Altus first!). In the end, the calculated times for our routes were within 5% of actual speedrun world records! Finally, using the path we calculated, we used Python and Matplotlib to visualize the route via a path drawn over the actual Elden Ring map. I've tried the route myself in-game and it works pretty well! </p>
