        <p>My name is Malcolm and I'm a student of Computer Science and Anthropology at UIUC (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign). "What a strange combination of fields," you're probably thinking. I agree, but at the same time, it's an awesome discipline that I can't praise enough. Through it, students gain the same core knowledge of computer science as pure CS majors as well as a strong background in the humanities to provide a unique perspective on technological challenges. I think the most important part of creating technology is making sure it as user-friendly and helpful as possible for anyone who uses it. My interests include software engineering, data science and basically all things related to data, and computer-human interaction. I'm also very interested in biological anthropology, namely primatology and paleoanthropology. </p>
