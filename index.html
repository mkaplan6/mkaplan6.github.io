        <h1>Hello!</h1>
        <p>My name is Malcolm and I'm a junior full stack software developer. I am a recent graduate of Computer Science and Anthropology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). On the computer science side, I'm primarily interested in computer systems and web/network programming. On the anthropology side, my focus is paleoanthropology, or the study of human evolution from the early apes to modern humans, primarily through fossils. No, there isn't really any overlap between those two parts, but maybe there will be one day. </p>

        <p>I actively work with C, C++, C#, Python, Go, Javascript/Typescript, HTML, and CSS, and in the past I've worked with Java, x86 and MIPS Assembly, VBA, Verilog, SQL, R, and GML. Outside of computer science, I also work a lot with multimedia editing tools such as Photoshop and Sony Vegas, which I use to create video essay projects for school and YouTube (fun fact: these YouTube videos have a total of over 1,000,000 views!).</p>

            My most interesting projects have been an interactive map web console in Typescript that displays real-time locations of buses, a backend service in C# to parse bus location information from a database and calculate estimated arrival times, a Python application that efficiently and securely communicates with proximity beacons via LoRaWAN technology, and a VBA (Excel) schedule generator to help airport staff to assign van drivers to service flights throughout the workday given a set of constraints. I often also actively communicate with clients and write up detailed project reports to guide users through setup and execution of the programs.</p>

            From January to May 2024, I was a course assistant for UIUC's computer architecture class. My primary job was to hold office hours to guide students through the creation and debugging of lab assignments focused on CPU design and optimization. We build some really cool stuff in these labs: we start off by creating simple computer components like register files and ALUs and move on to create fully-functional 32-bit CPUs, all in Verilog. Then we optimize these CPUs by adding in pipelining and interrupt handling. We then transition into MIPS Assembly coding assignments, which focus on teaching students how machine-level programming works, culminating in a project called Lab Spimbot that requires students to optimize the movement of a virtual robot using interrupt handling in Assembly. Additionally, some assignments have students create and optimize simulations of caches as well as implement parallelism, all in C and C++. I also taught students the conceptual bases behind these topics and more.

            In Spring of 2024, I led a team of 4 engineers over 8 weeks to construct a simplified Linux-like operating system (or kernel) from scratch in C and x86 Assembly. The final product (with over 13,000 lines of code) was a system that functions almost like a real kernel would. To implement it, we started with the basics: getting the system to boot by initializing the appropriate kernel-level data structures and initializing the hardware devices that handle interrupts. We then developed comprehensive device drivers for the keyboard, terminal, real-time clock, and timer. We implemented features to ensure security and speed, including virtual memory and file system abstractions. And the pièce de résistance of the project was support for running multiple processes simultaneously, including scheduling, system calls, and interrupt handling. </p>

            In Fall of 2024, I and one partner built a fault-tolerant stream processing framework from the ground up in Golang that runs on a cluster of 10 machines in parallel. By the end, it totalled over 4,600 lines of code, and is capable of processing many thousands of records of data within minutes (nothing compared to the likes of Apache Spark and other professional systems, but we were still proud). Users of the framework can input their own custom operations and their own input data. To support this stream processing system, we engineered a fault-tolerant distributed file system for safely and efficiently storing inputs, outputs, and intermediate data during the computations. This distributed file system was also strongly consistent, such that no machines ever accidently obtained outdated data. We also implemented the SWIM protocol, which provides efficient and fully-complete failure detection among nodes in the cluster. As nodes in the cluster left, failed, or rejoined the system, the distributed file system and stream processing framework would quickly handle the change so that everything continued to run effectively. This system may be the most complex coding project I've ever done. </p>

            In middle school, I made a game in the style of Five Nights at Freddy's in Scratch, the tool that is used to teach kids how to program. Then, I forgot about this game for about 10 years. But in Spring of 2025, I decided I wanted to make a game in a real programming language, so I figured I could repurpose the visuals I made way back when and redo the coding from the ground up. The game is written entirely in C# with the Godot Game Engine and is roughly 10,000 lines of code. About 85% of the visuals are from the original, though often with minor tweaks. The game, like Five Nights at Freddy's, consists of the player being stationary with nothing but a camera system and a few other tools to survive from an increasingly chaotic onslaught of scary enemies for five (or more) nights. Click the title of this project to see the trailer for the game, which itself has a link in the description to its GameJolt page where it will be uploaded to and be free to download.</p>

            In Spring of 2023, I and a few friends created a C++ program that reads in data from the Elden Ring map and calculates an optimal speedrunning route using various modifications of graph traversal algorithms like Dijkstra's and Floyd-Warshall. The algorithms find shortest paths between nodes while simultaneously accounting for all the intricacies of the video game and enforcing certain pathways (you can't fight Radahn without visiting Altus first!). In the end, the calculated times for our routes were within 5% of actual speedrun world records! Finally, using the path we calculated, we used Python and Matplotlib to visualize the route via a path drawn over the actual Elden Ring map. I've tried the route myself in-game and it works pretty well! </p>
