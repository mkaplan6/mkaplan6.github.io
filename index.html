    <h1>Hello there!</h1>

    <p>If you can say a fitting follow-up line (whether it be from Star Wars or the blink-182 song), we could definitely be friends.</p>
    <p>My name is Malcolm and I'm a student of Computer Science and Anthropology at UIUC (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign). "What a strange combination of fields," you're probably thinking. I agree, but at the same time, it's an awesome discipline that I can't praise enough. Through it, students gain the same core knowledge of computer science as pure CS majors as well as a strong background in the humanities to provide a unique perspective on technological challenges. I think the most important part of creating technology is making sure it as user-friendly and helpful as possible for anyone who uses it. My interests include software engineering, data science and basically all things related to data, and computer-human interaction. I'm also very interested in biological anthropology, namely primatology and paleoanthropology. </p>
    <p>I actively work with C++, Python, Java, and VBA/Excel, and in the past I've worked with C#, JavaScript, R, GML, and of course this website is programmed in HTML and CSS. Although not related to computer science, I also work a lot with multimedia editing tools such as Photoshop and Sony Vegas, which I use to create projects for honors courses as well as YouTube videos.</p>

    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
    <h3>Software Engineering Intern at AvTech Corp.</h3>
    <p>For the past two summers now, I've been an intern for the software engineering department at AvTech Corp., creating and improving programs relating to the aviation industry. My most interesting projects have been a Python application that efficiently and securely communicates with proximity beacons via LoRaWAN technology, and a VBA (Excel) schedule generator to help airport staff assign drivers to service flights throughout the workday. For both projects, I actively communicated with clients and wrote up detailed project reports to guide users through setup and execution of the programs. Additionally, I have spent some time parsing through huge codebases to implement new features and find bugs within existing applications, primarily in Java. I also did a little bit of testing of both hardware and software. </p>
    
    <h3>Discrete Structures (CS 173) Course Assistant at UIUC</h3>
    <p>In Spring of 2023, I was a course assistant for the introductory discrete mathematics class for computer science majors. During this time, I held scheduleded office hours, attended discussion sections, an answered student questions on Discord and course forums to help teach students aboutn fundamental computer science topics. Such topics include algorithm analysis, boolean algebra, recursion, sets, graphs, and trees.</p>

    <h2>Activities</h2>
    <h3>Association for Computing Machinery at UIUC</h3>
    <p>During my time at UIUC, I've been involved in the largest computer science student organization on campus, primarily in the special interest groups SIGCHI (the special interest group for computer-human interaction) and Game Builders.</p>

    <h3>Treasurer of the Illini Classics Club</h3>
    <p>I also serve as the treasurer of the Illini Classics Club, which is the organization for students on campus interested in classical texts, philosophy, and all that fun stuff. </p>
